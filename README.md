***Gemma Benchmarking Framework***

I have demonstrated a simple framework to load and evaluate Gemini and other models on the MMLU dataset (10 samples), and check their accuracy.

**It contains two files with multiple scripts to:**

**Load the data**

**Load the model**

**Create prompts**

**show the models to evaluate accuracy**

It also has another file that contains a script to:

**Load the dataset**

T**est it on multiple models**

**Evaluate the performance**

**Display graphical results for samples**
