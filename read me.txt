In this mini project,
I have demonstrated a simple framework to load and evaluate Gemini and other models on the MMLU dataset (10 samples), and check their accuracy.

For memory efficiency and other related tasks, I have also developed a separate CLI-based tool called LMLyzer â€” please check it out.
